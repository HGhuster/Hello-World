All judgements are, in their rationale, statistics.

It is still hard for me to recall my astonishment when I first read the quotation above.

When I was a freshman, I participated in the summer social practice of investigating the hybridpower car market development, visited BYD's electric car factory, and conducted aquestionnaire survey in popular tourist attractions and public places in Nanjing. In this process,I deeply felt the enormous social and economic benefits of technological innovation. Bothconsumers and environmental protection benefit from it. However, at that time, the news of carcompanies cheating government subsidies by fabricating sales of new energy vehiclesfrequently appeared in China, which made me very sad. I communicated with my friends infinance majors and learned that for companies listed on the stock market, the CSRC wouldrequire them to disclose information to the public regularly. Suppose more car companies raisemore money through open capital markets. In that case, they can be under the public'ssupervision, and the development of the new energy vehicle industry may be more positive. Iwas impressed by the significant role of financial markets in improving the efficiency of usingfunds, and I began to learn the relevant knowledge of finance by myself.

During my undergraduate, I learned nuclear engineering and technology at HuazhongUniversity of Science and Technology, ranking seventh in my major. I performed very well inall mathematics classes, such as calculus (90), linear algebra (93), probability theory andmathematical statistics (96), and complex function and integral transform (93). At the sametime, I took the initiative to act as a representative of many challenging courses, and I alsoachieved good results in related classes, such as theoretical mechanics (97) and mechanicalprinciples (93). As a result, I was recommended postgraduate in a nuclear engineering major.However, my heart is already yearning for finance, and I resolutely chose to take the exam andexplore the finance area.

While studying diligently, I also actively participated in academic research and StudentUnion.In the sophomore summer vacation, with curiosity about scientific research, I joined thecomputer simulation research project of material irradiation in my school, which gave mepreliminary academic research training. My main task is to learn how to use LAMMPS softwareto simulate the radiation damage mechanism of the first wall material of Tokamak and comparethe computer simulation results with the experimental observation results. While studying the radiation damage of the material, the first wall material's radiation resistance is optimized bychanging the composition and structure in the computer simulation. Meanwhile, I activelyparticipated in the Student Union serving students and joined the Cultural CommunicationDepartment. I am responsible for applying a budget of 3,000 yuan to the school every semesterto buy the books students wanted to read and for the weekend duty of Qiming study.Simultaneously, I also organized a bi-weekly 25-person movie sharing session to enricheveryone's cultural life.

When I prepared the graduation thesis, I chose to study the public acceptance of nuclear energyfrom behavioral economics. Under my advisor's guidance, I independently collected and sortedout the data through the questionnaires. Through using the different expressions of the samequestion in the questionnaire and the asymmetry of people's nuclear radiation value functionobtained by data analysis, I verified that people's irrational fear of nuclear energy could bepartially explained from the perspective of frame effect and prospect theory in behavioraleconomics. And I put forward some suggestions to improve public acceptance of nuclear energyaccordingly.
